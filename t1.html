<p>Whether it's part of your inter-railing gap yahh or just as part of a weekend city break;&nbsp;​the small city of&nbsp;Lübeck in Northern&nbsp;Germany is WELL worth your visit this Christmas.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="article-sub-title">How to get there</h3><p>Located in Northern Germany, Hamburg is the closest airport to fly into. From there, you can get the train to Lübeck. They run hourly and only&nbsp;take&nbsp;about 40&nbsp;mins, so it's pretty simple.</p><h3 class="article-sub-title">Where to stay</h3><p>Lübeck runs along the Baltic coast, but to get a real Christmassy feel of&nbsp;the city, we reckon it's best to stay within the city's gates. The Old Town (or the Alstadt) is surrounded by water on all sides and&nbsp;there are&nbsp;loads of places to stay - to suit whatever your budget. The&nbsp;Radisson Blu on the water is gorgeous and close to the Holstentor city gate. &nbsp;If you're feeling fancy there's&nbsp;Hotel Anno 1216 which&nbsp;has traditional German rooms&nbsp;(apparently&nbsp;the Swedish King once stayed) or if you're doing it on the cheap - Air BnB has great budget friendly rooms.<span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space"></span></span><span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space">​<span class="redactor-invisible-space" data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="redactor-invisible-space"></span></span></p><h3 class="article-sub-title">What to do</h3><p>There's LOADS to do to really fill your time with in Lübeck.
